## 🤔 What is this?

**WA_Clone** is a minimal WhatsApp-style chat interface built to understand how modern messaging apps are structured on the frontend.

No ads.  
No spam forwards.  

Just UI, logic, and peace. 😌

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

Simple tools. Solid choices.

- ⚛️ **React** — component-based UI, no chaos  
- ⚡ **Vite** — fast builds because life is short  
- 🟨 **JavaScript (ES6+)** — flexible, powerful, sometimes annoying  
- 🎨 **CSS** — simple styling, no unnecessary drama  
- 🧹 **ESLint** — politely tells me when my code is nonsense  

> Backend not included (yet).  
> Frontend doing frontend things — properly. 🧑‍💻

cd WA-Clone
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` and enjoy pretending you built WhatsApp 😄

## 🚀 Why I Built This
